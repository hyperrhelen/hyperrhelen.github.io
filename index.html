  		<p>Hi, if you're looking at this, you've made it to my personal website. It is still currently under construction ... since there isn't much up on it right now. :-) 
      Anyways, my name is Helen and I am  a fourth year computer science major at University of California, Davis and I love to code. </p>

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>Here are some projects that I've worked on with others and on my own. If you're looking for the source code, you can find most of them in my Github, otherwise, if you ask, I can send them to you.</p>

          <b>Fort Nitta:</b> Worked together in a team of 15 to port a game from Linux over to Windows, writing code in C# and learning to use the Microsoft tools and IDE's such as Visual Studio, using the gaming library Monogame. I was one of the team's Point of Contact that dealt with reaching out to other teams to come to terms with documentation styles and finding times to meet for collaborative work. I specifically worked together with the Artificial Intelligence team to get Single Player to work, where we integrated Lua into C#. The game is a remake of the popular Atari game, Rampart. This game was made for learning how to work together with a team.
